Will update soon, to have clearer, better written code.

This is a TODO app, with Crud functionality (create new todo, read existing todos, delete todos, update todos by marking them complete). The data is saved on google Firebase SDK Firestore, used as a back end solution. There is also user authentication (using Firebase Authentication with Firebase pre-built UI). Only authenticated users can read/write data.
